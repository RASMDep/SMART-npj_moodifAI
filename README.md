<b> MoodifAI: Unveiling Psychophysiological States Through Advanced AI  </b>
<br clear="left"/>
</h1><br>


## Overview

This repository contains the codebase for **MoodifAI**, a framework designed to explore and analyze mood patterns using advanced AI techniques. The project focuses on preprocessing wearable patch data, generating time series features, and training deep learning models for psychophysiological state assessment.  

The work is associated with the paper:  
**"Longitudinal and Objective Psychophysiological State Assessment in Real-World Settings: A Data-Driven Analysis of Wearable Patch Data"**.

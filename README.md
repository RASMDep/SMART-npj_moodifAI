## Overview

This repository contains code for a machine learning project focused on predicting valence and arousal using heart rate variability (HRV) and accelerometer (ACC) time series data. 

## Data File

- **Location:** `/Projects_Current/Ambizione/10_Studies/2_SMART/Data/valence-arousal-paper`
- **File Name(s):** `HRV_ACC_timeseries_24hour_clean_25percent_smart.pkl`


These files contain preprocessed HRV and ACC time series data, and they serve as the input for the machine learning models developed in this project.
